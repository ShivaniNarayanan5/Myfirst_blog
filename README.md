# My Data Quality Journey 🚀 📊

Hi 👋 I’m **Shivani**, a Senior Analyst with 4+ years of experience at **Wipro**. I specialize in keeping data clean, reliable, and ready for action in the **BFSI** sector 🏦.

This space is where I share my project learnings, SQL techniques, and how I'm scaling my data expertise.

### 👩‍💻 What I Do: The Front Lines of Data Integrity
In the world of banking data, precision is everything. I handle millions of transactional records to ensure accuracy across complex systems.

* **Source-to-Target (S2T) Validation:** Using SQL to ensure data maps perfectly.
* **Financial Reconciliation:** Validating balances and control totals 💰.
* **Batch Load Testing:** Monitoring daily data refreshes for zero-error performance ⚙️.
* **Defect Leadership:** Root-cause analysis and resolution using JIRA 🐞.

### 🧪 My Data Quality Framework
Before any data goes to production, it must pass these non-negotiable checks:

| Pillar | The Check | Objective |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Completeness** | Record Counts | No data lost during ETL 📈 |
| **Accuracy** | Sum/Amount Validation | Financial totals match perfectly ➕ |
| **Uniqueness** | Duplicate/Null Checks | Clean, non-redundant data ❌ |
| **Integrity** | Debit/Credit Reconciliation | Audit-ready balances ⚖️ |
| **Consistency** | Trend Analysis | Historical vs Current logic 🕒 |

### 🛠️ Tech Stack & Tools
* **SQL:** My primary tool for complex joins and data validation 🗄️.
* **Python:** Automating repetitive quality checks 🐍.
* **AWS S3:** Managing data storage in the cloud ☁️.
* **JIRA:** Professional defect tracking and lifecycle management 📝.
* **Excel:** Data analysis and reporting 📊.

### 🚀 Continuous Growth
I am currently focusing on:
* Building **automated validation frameworks** using Python.
* Deep-diving into **End-to-End ETL Pipeline** architecture.
* Mastering **Cloud-based data storage** and processing.
